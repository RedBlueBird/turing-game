# Turing Game - A Social Deduction Party Game Between Human & AI
*Azure AI Developer Hackathon Entry - Best Azure App Integration Category*

## Project Description
Turing Game is a real-time multiplayer social deduction game that leverages Azure's cloud infrastructure to deliver a seamless gaming experience. Players join virtual rooms to compete against an AI opponent. At each round of the game, every human and AI player responds to question prompts. They then vote and eliminate the player with the most AI-sounding response. Rounds continue until either one human remains or the AI is voted out.
